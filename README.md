# ansible-homelab

Playbooks I wrote to maintain my "ansible dexterity" after RHCE.

Nothing here is fancy, just functional and for practice only.

If you find anything here useful, feel free to use it.

# Types of playbooks

I am going to be writing playbooks as i go along my RHCA path
some playbooks will handle basic system administration stuff
some playbooks/roles will be more on the advanced side but i will
try to document everything properly since i am making this public.
